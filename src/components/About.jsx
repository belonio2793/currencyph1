        <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
          currency.ph uses real-world currency values and instruments but is essentially a digital ecosystem. There are no refunds, and withdrawals are disabled — the application is a realistic virtual experience with real life implications, measurable analytics and statistics. There are leaderboards, transparent account balances, recorded transactions and total transparency controls for sharing, creating a more fun and open environment across participants and players.

        <p className="mb-4 text-slate-700">
          You can deposit real money and see your balances credited. Spending your balance is limited to our partnerships; no real withdrawals can be made, and application-specific features can cost money, such as playing games and sending money. You may be able to spend your balance with our partners in exchange for goods and services but they must be registered within our network.
